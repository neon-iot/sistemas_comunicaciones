# Fundamentals of Communication Systems
## About this course
The Fundamentals of Communication Systems course is a course in the basic principles that govern the design and operation of information transmission systems at the level of the physical layer, with emphasis on electrical/electronic substrate systems. It is a first approach to the subject that does not seek to go in-depth or cover specific communication technologies. Instead, the student is given an overview of the area, providing it with the necessary tools to understand and analyze the operation of specific technologies.

## Main topics
* Analog and digital communication systems
* Error correction
* Bandpass digital modulation
* Exponential modulation
* Linear modulation
* Analog and digital performance
* Noise

## What you will learn
* Mention the main analog and digital modulation strategies.
* Identify the components of a communication system.
* Identify the design trade-offs inherent in a communication system.
* Design communication systems at the block diagram level satisfying given design constraints.
* Quantify the expected performance of a communication system according to its parameters in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (analog systems) and error rates (digital systems).
* Interpret descriptions of new communication technologies.

## What you will need:
* Previous knowledge of Fourier theory and filters, analysis
of steady and transient systems, and basic knowledge of
probability.
* Hardware (SDR kits).
